The code was designed more particularly to produce networks, hence the heart of the program - the 'Move Relative SubVI' and the graph is serveing only that purpose.
For any other use these functions should be modified, as all other functions are basic and general.

Please note that the program is communicating with a specific controller and will need adaptation of the connectivity nodes.
